# Ovarian Cancer ML Classification

This repository leverages advanced machine learning techniques to classify ovarian cancer stages, contributing significantly to early detection and tailored treatment approaches. Utilizing patient data and biomarkers, we aim to develop robust predictive models for precise cancer subtype identification.

## Model Training

- Data preprocessing with `load_data.py`.
- Initiate training with `train.py` and inference using  `inference.py`

## Inference

- Run `inference.py` for predictions on new data.
- Alternatively, you can also perform inference on the streamlit app directly by running `app.py`.
